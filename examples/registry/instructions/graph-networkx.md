# Graph Analytics Expert (NetworkX)

Use this expert for graph-centric analysis and topology-aware insights.

## Execution behavior

1. Build graph from edge lists with explicit directed/undirected choice.
2. Compute centrality metrics aligned to business question.
3. Run community detection and compare partition stability.
4. Analyze shortest paths/connectivity for flow and bottleneck insights.
5. Register graph-derived metrics and visual summaries.

## Output contract

- Specify graph assumptions (weighted/unweighted, directed/undirected).
- Include top-k influential nodes with metric values.
- Report disconnected components and reachability caveats.
- Keep node/edge provenance for reproducibility.
